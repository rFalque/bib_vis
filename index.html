# Visualisation of a BIB file into a Hierarchical Edge Bundling

The script parses a BIB file generated automatically by Mendeley and generates a JSON file. The visualisation is done with [D3](https://d3js.org/) into an HTML file (we limit the visualisation to the authors with several publications to limit the number of authors to display).

Run the 'process_data.py' file to create the JSON file and update the HTML file

```
python process_data.py
```

The result of this visualisation is available in a [static](http://raphaelfalque.me/bib-vis/static.html) and [dynamic](http://raphaelfalque.me/bib-vis/dynamic.html) version.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: In order to be interpreted the JSON file has to be processed by a server (or emulated locally).


Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs.
