@article{Ioffe2015,
abstract = {{Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch{\}}. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9{\%} top-5 validation error (and 4.8{\%} test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

@article{Long2015,
abstract = {Convolutional networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features. We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build "fully convolutional" networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20{\%} relative improvement to 62.2{\%} mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes less than one fifth of a second for a typical image.},

abstract = {We address a central problem of neuroanatomy, namely, the automatic segmentation of neuronal structures depicted in stacks of electron microscopy (EM) images. This is necessary to efﬁciently map 3D brain structure and connectivity. To segment biological neuron membranes, we use a special type of deep artiﬁcial neural network as a pixel classiﬁer. The label of each pixel (membrane or nonmembrane) is predicted from raw pixel values in a square window centered on it. The input layer maps each window pixel to a neuron. It is followed by a succession of convolutional and max-pooling layers which preserve 2D information and extract features with increasing levels of abstraction. The output layer produces a calibrated probability for each class. The classiﬁer is trained by plain gradient descent on a 512 512 30 stack with known ground truth, and tested on a stack of the same size (ground truth unknown to the authors) by the organizers of the ISBI 2012 EM Segmentation Challenge. Even without problem-speciﬁc postprocessing, our approach outperforms competing techniques by a large margin in all three considered metrics, i.e. rand error, warping error and pixel error. For pixel error, our approach is the only one outperforming a second human observer.},

With it has come a vast amount of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics.},

abstract = {Feature selection is one of the fundamental problems in pattern recognition and data mining. A popular and effective approach to feature selection is based on information theory, namely the mutual information of features and class variable. In this paper we compare eight different mutual information-based feature selection methods. Based on the analysis of the comparison results, we propose a new mutual information-based feature selection method. By taking into account both the class-dependent and class-independent correlation among features, the proposed method selects a less redundant and more informative set of features. The advantage of the proposed method over other methods is demonstrated by the results of experiments on UCI datasets (Asuncion and Newman, 2010 [1]) and object recognition. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper we report the set-up and results of the Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation (BRATS) benchmark organized in conjunction with the MICCAI 2012 and 2013 conferences. Twenty state-of-the-art tumor segmentation algorithms were applied to a set of 65 multi-contrast MR scans of low- and high-grade glioma patients - manually annotated by up to four raters - and to 65 comparable scans generated using tumor simulation software. Quantitative evaluations revealed considerable disagreement between the human raters in segmenting various tumor sub-regions (Dice scores in the range 74-85{\%}), illustrating the difficulty of this task. We found that different algorithms worked best for different sub-regions (reaching performance comparable to human inter-rater variability), but that no single algorithm ranked in the top for all subregions simultaneously. Fusing several good algorithms using a hierarchical majority vote yielded segmentations that consistently ranked above all individual algorithms, indicating remaining opportunities for further methodological improvements. The BRATS image data and manual annotations continue to be publicly available through an online evaluation system as an ongoing benchmarking resource.},

abstract = {Segmentation is a popular preprocessing stage in the field of machine vision. In agricultural applications it can be used to distinguish between living plant material and soil in images. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and excess green (ExG) color features are often used in the segmentation of images with multiple color channels. In this paper, a Bayesian method is used to combine existing color features into a common color feature. This feature is then used to segment images into separate regions containing vegetation and soil. The common color feature produces an improved segmentation over the normalized vegetation difference index and excess green. The inputs to this color feature are the R, G, B, and near-infrared color wells, their chromaticities, and NDVI, ExG, and excess red. We apply the developed technique to a dataset consisting of 20 manually segmented images captured under artificial illumination. The results show that our combined feature enables better segmentation using the individual color features. Better segmentation allows for more robust vision-based weeding, thereby allowing for lower safety margins within cell-sprayers and lower herbicide usage.},

abstract = {Deep learning has gained tremendous attention in applied machine learning. However such tools for regression and classification do not capture model uncertainty. Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. We show that dropout in neural networks (NNs) can be cast as a Bayesian approximation. As a direct result we obtain tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs -- extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the dropout uncertainty properties. Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. We finish by using dropout uncertainty in a Bayesian pipeline, with deep reinforcement learning as a practical task.},

abstract = {Autonomous vehicle navigation in dynamic urban environments requires localization accuracy exceeding that available from GPS-based inertial guidance systems. We have shown previously that GPS, IMU, and LIDAR data can be used to generate a high-resolution infrared remittance ground map that can be subsequently used for localization [4]. We now propose an extension to this approach that yields substantial improvements over previous work in vehicle localization, including higher precision, the ability to learn and improve maps over time, and increased robustness to environment changes and dynamic obstacles. Specifically, we model the environment, instead of as a spatial grid of fixed infrared remittance values, as a probabilistic grid whereby every cell is represented as its own gaussian distribution over remittance values. Subsequently, Bayesian inference is able to preferentially weight parts of the map most likely to be stationary and of consistent angular reflectivity, thereby reducing uncertainty and catastrophic errors. Furthermore, by using offline SLAM to align multiple passes of the same environment, possibly separated in time by days or even months, it is possible to build an increasingly robust understanding of the world that can be then exploited for localization. We validate the effectiveness of our approach by using these algorithms to localize our vehicle against probabilistic maps in various dynamic environments, achieving RMS accuracy in the 10cm-range and thus outperforming previous work. Importantly, this approach has enabled us to autonomously drive our vehicle for hundreds of miles in dense traffic on narrow urban roads which were formerly unnavigable with previous localization methods. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

We use 121 data sets, which represent the whole UCI data base (excluding the large-scale problems) and other own real problems, in order to achieve significant conclusions about the classifier behavior, not dependent on the data set col-lection. The classifiers most likely to be the bests are the random forest (RF) versions, the best of which (implemented in R and accessed via caret) achieves 94.1{\%} of the maximum accuracy overcoming 90{\%} in the 84.3{\%} of the data sets. However, the dif-ference is not statistically significant with the second best, the SVM with Gaussian kernel implemented in C using LibSVM, which achieves 92.3{\%} of the maximum accuracy. A few models are clearly better than the remaining ones: random forest, SVM with Gaussian and polynomial kernels, extreme learning machine with Gaussian kernel, C5.0 and avNNet (a committee of multi-layer perceptrons implemented in R with the caret package). The random forest is clearly the best family of classifiers (3 out of 5 bests classifiers are RF), followed by SVM (4 classifiers in the top-10), neural networks and boosting ensembles (5 and 3 members in the top-20, respectively).},

abstract = {A new information-theoretic approach is presented for finding the registration of volumetric medical images of differing modalities. Registration is achieved by adjustment of the relative position and orientation until the mutual information between the images is maximized. In our derivation of the registration procedure, few assumptions are made about the nature of the imaging process. As a result the algorithms are quite general and can foreseeably be used with a wide variety of imaging devices. This approach works directly with image data; no pre-processing or segmentation is required. This technique is, however, more flexible and robust than other intensity-based techniques like correlation. Additionally, it has an efficient implementation that is based on stochastic approximation. Experiments are presented that demonstrate the approach registering magnetic resonance (MR) images with computed tomography (CT) images, and with positron-emission tomography (PET) images. Surgical applications of the registration method are described.},

abstract = {There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net .},

abstract = {The naive Bayes classifier greatly simplify learning by assuming that features are independent given class. Although independence is generally a poor assumption, in practice naive Bayes often competes well with more sophisticated classifiers. Our broad goal is to understand the data characteristics which affect the performance of naive Bayes. Our approach uses Monte Carlo simulations that allow a systematic study of classification accuracy for several classes of randomly generated problems. We analyze the impact of the distribution entropy on the classification error, showing that low-entropy feature distributions yield good performance of naive Bayes. We also demonstrate that naive Bayes works well for certain nearlyfunctional feature dependencies, thus reaching its best performance in two opposite cases: completely independent features (as expected) and functionally dependent features (which is surprising). Another surprising result is that the accuracy of naive Bayes is not directly correlated with the degree of feature dependencies measured as the class conditional mutual information between the features. Instead, a better predictor of naive Bayes accuracy is the amount of information about the class that is lost because of the independence assumption.},

abstract = {Accurate registration of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (FMRI) T2*-weighted volumes to same-subject high-resolution T1-weighted structural volumes is important for Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) FMRI and crucial for applications such as cortical surface-based analyses and pre-surgical planning. Such registration is generally implemented by minimizing a cost functional, which measures the mismatch between two image volumes over the group of proper affine transformations. Widely used cost functionals, such as mutual information (MI) and correlation ratio (CR), appear to yield decent alignments when visually judged by matching outer brain contours. However, close inspection reveals that internal brain structures are often significantly misaligned. Poor registration is most evident in the ventricles and sulcal folds, where CSF is concentrated. This observation motivated our development of an improved modality-specific cost functional which uses a weighted local Pearson coefficient (LPC) to align T2*- and T1-weighted images. In the absence of an alignment gold standard, we used three human observers blinded to registration method to provide an independent assessment of the quality of the registration for each cost functional. We found that LPC performed significantly better (p {\textless} 0.001) than generic cost functionals including MI and CR. Generic cost functionals were very often not minimal near the best alignment, thereby suggesting that optimization is not the cause of their failure. Lastly, we emphasize the importance of precise visual inspection of alignment quality and present an automated method for generating composite images that help capture errors of misalignment.},

abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

abstract = {A new approach to the problem of multimodality medical image registration is proposed, using a basic concept from information theory, mutual information (MI), or relative entropy, as a new matching criterion. The method presented in this paper applies MI to measure the statistical dependence or information redundancy between the image intensities of corresponding voxels in both images, which is assumed to be maximal if the images are geometrically aligned. Maximization of MI is a very general and powerful criterion, because no assumptions are made regarding the nature of this dependence and no limiting constraints are imposed on the image content of the modalities involved. The accuracy of the MI criterion is validated for rigid body registration of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and photon emission tomography (PET) images by comparison with the stereotactic registration solution, while robustness is evaluated with respect to implementation issues, such as interpolation and optimization, and image content, including partial overlap and image degradation. Our results demonstrate that subvoxel accuracy with respect to the stereotactic reference solution can be achieved completely automatically and without any prior segmentation, feature extraction, or other preprocessing steps which makes this method very well suited for clinical applications.},

In this application where misalignment can be large with respect to the imaged field of view, invariance to overlap statistics is an important consideration. Current entropy measures are reviewed and a normalised measure is proposed which is simply the ratio of the sum of the marginal entropies and the joint entropy. The effect of changing overlap on current entropy measures and this normalised measure are compared using a simple image model and experiments on clinical image data. Results indicate that the normalised entropy measure provides significantly improved behaviour over a range of imaged fields of view.},

abstract = {Decision trees are attractive classifiers due to their high execution speed. But trees derived with traditional methods often cannot be grown to arbitrary complexity for possible loss of generalization accuracy on unseen data. The limitation on complexity usually means suboptimal accuracy on training data. Following the principles of stochastic modeling, we propose a method to construct tree-based classifiers whose capacity can be arbitrarily expanded for increases in accuracy for both training and unseen data. The essence of the method is to build multiple trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space. Trees in, different subspaces generalize their classification in complementary ways, and their combined classification can be monotonically improved. The validity of the method is demonstrated through experiments on the recognition of handwritten digits},
